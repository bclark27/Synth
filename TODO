SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
    1: need to install packages
        This synth uses the soundio library with ALSA and Pulse in linux for audio output. install these packages for compilation and running:
            sudo apt install libpulse-dev libasound2-dev libsndfile-dev
    2: need to set controller permissions:
        This synth uses the Ableton Push MIDI controller and USB read write permissions must be set up for the controller to oporate
        1: create this permissions file for the ableton push
            sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ableton-push.rules
        2: paste these permissions inside the file:
            SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="09e8", ATTR{idProduct}=="0015", MODE="0666"
        3 save and close. now run these commands to refresh the USB permissions:
            sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
            sudo udevadm trigger
